# Portfolio Website
This is my portfolio website which I host on AWS Amplify so I could learn how to host a static website with AWS services. I did not do the frontend of this website. I consider myself mainly a data scientist and backend developer so I spend more time on building data science and backend projects to show my wide range of skills.

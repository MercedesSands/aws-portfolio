# Portfolio Website
This is my portfolio website which I decided to host on AWS Amplify so I could learn how to host a static website with AWS services. I did not do the frontend of this website. I consider myself mainly a backend developer so I spend more time on building backend projects to show my wide range of skills with using Python and JavaScript to build applications.

# Portfolio Website
This is my portfolio website where I only worked on the backend with Flask and hosted the website on AWS. The goal of this project was to build a fully functional backend application. This project helped me improve my python and flask skills. I also have a better understanding on how to use AWS. On this website you can find some of my projects in backend development and machine learning. My strengths right now is in backend development.
